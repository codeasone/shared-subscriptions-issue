# Minimal demonstration of shared subscriptions issue

## Effects

- [âœ“] Bug exists Release Version 1.1.1 ( Master Branch)
- [?] Bug exists in Snapshot Version 1.1.2-SNAPSHOT (Develop Branch)

`HEAD` of `develop` branch appears to be broken wrt. my test program suggesting a regression wrt. `1.1.x` API current exists, which may or may not be related.

## Issue

Callbacks don't get called when subscribing to [shared subscriptions](http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-client-load-balancing-with-shared-subscriptions/), e.g. `$share/group/topic`, using the `subscribe(String topicFilter, int qos, IMqttMessageListener messageListener)`API [(code)](https://github.com/codeasone/shared-subscriptions-issue/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/codeasone/SharedSubscriptionsIssue.java#L49-L50).

However, shared subscriptions work as expected when using the `setCallback(...)` [(code)](https://github.com/codeasone/shared-subscriptions-issue/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/codeasone/SharedSubscriptionsIssue.java#L43-L46) API before invoking `subscribe(String topicFilter, int qos)`.

This issue impacts downstream wrappers such as the Clojure library [machine-head](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/machine_head), which is what led me here...

## Instructions

- Run a local MQTT broker `localhost:1883` that supports [shared subscriptions](http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-client-load-balancing-with-shared-subscriptions/) e.g. HiveMQ

In the root of this project:

- `make build`
- `make run`

## Expected

```

```

It's clear that the messages are load-balanced in a round-robin fashion across the two subscribers.

8 messages received in total.

For completeness, compare with normal subscription behaviour:
